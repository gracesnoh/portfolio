    <p><a href="http://stingemart.wix.com/home-page" target="_blank">Restart</a> was a class project in a Social Entrepreneurship class. It is a web platform that connects businesses with artists and the community to combat graffiti with murals in cities: an <p1>urban mural crowdsourcing platform. </p1>I designed the user experience of the website and led the branding initiatives.</p>

    <p>The landing page of <a href="http://stingemart.wix.com/home-page" target="_blank">the website</a> first gives a brief description of the organization and underneath lets users view ongoing campaigns. Each campaign gives the basic details such as location, company, number of submitted art ideas, and days left of the campaign. I was inspired by <a href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>'s user flow for their crowdfunding campaigns. Once you click on a campaign, users are able to vote on current ideas submitted by other artists or submit their own artwork.</p>

	<p>I chose the name RestART because it was a play on words for the words "restart" and "art. I wanted to get across the message that we are trying to develop <p1>a new beginning</p1> for appreciating urban art. For the logo, I chose the iconic power button icon to further emphasize restarting and made the "ART" in RestART stand out by filling it in with a mural-like pattern.

	At the end of semester, we pitched our idea to our professors and judges with this slide deck I designed. It pinpoints the problem we are addressing and explains the basic structure of our company.</p>

    <h5>Talking to Stakeholders</h5>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to meet a lot of our stakeholders. I jumped on a call with an <p1>SF Art Commissioner</p1> to discuss existing local initiatives to promote urban art. I walked into <p1>small businesses</p1> around Berkeley to ask managers if they would be interested in funding  murals. I asked <p1>my student colleagues</p1> if they would vote on a platform like this. And coolest of all, I hung out with a bunch of <p1>street artists</p1> in the SF Mission District and watched them spray paint all day.</p>
