    <h5>Guiding Your Users</h5>
	<hr>

	    <div class="prototype">
	    <iframe id="prototype" align="middle" width="438" height="930" src="http://invis.io/W3570KX9P" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	    </div>
    
    <p>One of my recent freelance design projects was working with <a href="https://www.monsterproducts.com/" target="_blank">Monster Cable</a> on improving the UI of their mobile app for their <p1>wireless speaker system, SoundStage.</p1> The Monster team found that customers were unhappy with the current mobile experience, so they brought me in for analysis and a design overhaul for the initial speaker setup process.</p>
    
    <h5>1. Step-by-Step</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <p>The current experience for setting up a speaker consists of graphic illustrations and blocks of text. One problem with this UI is that users are inclined to click wildly past these important instructions because a big glaringly red button that saids "Next" begs them to. </p>
    <br>

    <div class="collage">

    	<img src="images/monster-3.PNG" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-1.PNG" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-2.PNG" class="small-pic">
    </div>	
    <br>
    <p>To better guide the users, I numbered each step to simulate an order, bolded important wait times, and color-coded words that signified when to look out for specific light colors on the speaker. I also placed less emphasis on the "Next" button so that users would not fly through the instructions and get lost.</p>
    <br>

    <div class="collage">

    	<img src="images/monster-new-2.png" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-new-3.png" class="small-pic">

    </div>	

    <h5>2. Helpful Hints</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <p>There were a few <p1>recurring points of confusion</p1> among users during the setup process. Many users had trouble powering up the speaker and understanding what WPS setup was. To address these frequent barriers, I added <p1>"helpful hints"</p1> that provide more detailed instructions on these steps. Once a user clicks into one, they can easily return back to the setup process by pressing "OK."</p>
    <br>

    </div>	

    <h5>3. Back and Forth?</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <p>Another painpoint of the current experience is setting up the Wi-Fi network. Due to the nature of the speaker, the iOS Wi-Fi setup requires exiting the SoundStage app and going into iOS settings and into Safari. This is not ideal, since it <p1>sends users back and forth</p1> from app to app.</p>
    <br>

    <div class="collage">

    	<img src="images/monster-4.PNG" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-5.PNG" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-6.PNG" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-7.PNG" class="small-pic">
    </div>	
    
    <br>
    <p>To mitigate this inconvenience and reduce confusion, I <p1>warned users ahead of time</p1> that they will need to exit the app to perform the following instructions. I added a bolded instruction at the top that strongly suggests users to read through the next steps prior to leaving the app. Then at the end, users can return back to Step 1 to actually execute the steps.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>4. A More Fitting Android Design</h5>
    <hr><br>

    <p>The current app experience for Android differs from the iOS version slightly, but <p1>does not fit typical Android design principles.</p1></p>
    <br>
    <div class="collage">

    	<img src="images/monster-android-1.jpg" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-android-2.jpg" class="small-pic">

    </div>	
    <br>
    <p>Instead, I used the ubiquitous Android font "Roboto" to better suit the Android version, and included familiar "Back" and "Next" arrow buttons that are often seen in popular Android apps.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="collage">

    	<img src="images/monster-android-new-1.png" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-android-new-2.png" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-android-new-3.png" class="small-pic">
    	<img src="images/monster-android-new-4.png" class="small-pic">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>These changes have yet to be included in the newest app release, so I am looking forward to seeing the results of these UI improvements once they are implemented. If you haven't already, check out the <a href="#top">Invision prototype</a> I made at the top of this page.</p>

	<h5>Takeaways</h5>
	<hr><br>
	<p>
	1. Guiding users requires transparency.
	<br>
	2. Android and iOS demand different design principles!
