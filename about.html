        <h5>The Intersection of Design and Coffee</h5><hr>
        <div class="crop"><img src="images/me-coffee.png" ></div>

        <p>Hi there! My name is Grace Noh and I am a designer. I am currently pursuing my own course of study centered on Culture/Cognition in Technology at UC Berkeley. As you can tell from my portfolio, <p1>design</p1> is one of my greatest passions. And as you can probably tell from my picture, another one of my passions is <p1>coffee</p1>. 
        <br><br>
        I can't say that I am a fantastic barista, but I do brew my own coffee from time to time. When I first started off, I would made some pretty horrible coffee (my apartment mates can attest to that). It was only after continual experimenting and tweaking small measurements that I managed to pull off decent to pretty good cups of coffee.</p>
        
        <h5>The Process</h5>
        <hr><br>
        <p>I quickly realized <p1>the process</p1> was the key to a brewing a good 'ol cup of Joe. I would isolate variables such as water temperature and bean coarseness to determine what to correct the next time I brewed. If I hadn't looked back on the process, I would still be making horrible coffee to this very day.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Similarly for design, <p1>the process</p1> is where I learn the most and reflect upon for future improvement. You will find that a lot of my portfolio pieces include initial sketches to shed some light on the process I went through to build the final product.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>The process isn't only important for designing and brewing coffee. I hope that you will also find the value of the process in your passions!</p>
